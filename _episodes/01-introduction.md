Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning. Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligent

While Machine Learning utilizes many different algorithm, Deep Learning only focuses on using Artificial Neural Network

While Machine Learning mostly uses Shallow Neural Network (1 or max 2 hidden layers), Deep Learning tends to use multiple hidden layers between input and output.

Some notable applications of Deep Learning

## Deep Learning Models
In this workshop we focus on several typical Deep Learning models:

(1) Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

(2) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

(3) Autoencoders

## Deep Learning Framework

(1) Keras

- Keras is an effective high-level neural network Application Programming Interface (API) written in Python. This open-source neural network library is designed to provide fast experimentation with deep neural networks, and it can run on top of CNTK, TensorFlow, and Theano.
- Keras focuses on being modular, user-friendly, and extensible. It doesn’t handle low-level computations; instead, it hands them off to another library called the Backend.
- Keras was adopted and integrated into TensorFlow in mid-2017. Users can access it via the tf.keras module. However, the Keras library can still operate separately and independently.

(2) Pytorch
- Pytorch is a relatively new deep learning framework based on Torch.
- Developed by Facebook’s AI research group and open-sourced on GitHub in 2017, it’s used for natural language processing applications.
- Pytorch has a reputation for simplicity, ease of use, flexibility, efficient memory usage, and dynamic computational graphs. It also feels native, making coding more manageable and increasing processing speed.

(3) Tensorflow
- TensorFlow is an end-to-end open-source deep learning framework developed by Google and released in 2015.
- It is known for documentation and training support, scalable production and deployment options, multiple abstraction levels, and support for different platforms, such as Android.
- TensorFlow is a symbolic math library used for neural networks and is best suited for dataflow programming across a range of tasks. It offers multiple abstraction levels for building and training models.

(4) Theano
- Theano used to be one of the more popular deep learning libraries, an open-source project that lets programmers define, evaluate, and optimize mathematical expressions, including multi-dimensional arrays and matrix-valued expressions.
- Theano was developed by the Universite de Montreal in 2007 and is a key foundational library used for deep learning in Python. It’s considered the grandfather of deep learning frameworks and has fallen out of favor by most researchers outside academia.
