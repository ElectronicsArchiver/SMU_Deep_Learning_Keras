# Recurrent Neural Networks
### Introduction
- RNNs are type of Deep Learning models with built-in feedback mechanism. 
- The output of a particular layer can be **re-fed** as the input in order to predict the output.

### Applications
- It is specifically designed for Sequential problem **Weather forecast, Stock forecast, Image captioning, Natural Language Processing, Speech/Voice Recognition**

### Some Disadvantages of RNN: 
- Computationally Expensive and large memory requested
- RNN is sensitive to changes in parameters and having **Exploding Gradient** or **Vanishing Gradient**
- In order to resolve the gradient problem of RNN, a method Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) is proposed.

In this limited workshop, we only cover LSTM for timeseries forecast problem.

# Long-Short Term Memory model - LSTM
### Introduction
- LSTMs are a special kind of RNN â€” capable of learning long-term dependencies by remembering information for long periods is the default behavior.
- They were introduced by Hochreiter & Schmidhuber (1997) and were refined and popularized by many people
- LSTMs are explicitly designed to avoid the long-term dependency problem.

### Comparison between traditional RNN and LSTM
