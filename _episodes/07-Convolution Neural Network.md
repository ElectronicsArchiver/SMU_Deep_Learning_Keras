## Convolutional Neural Network - CNN


- CNNs are one type of ANN which utilize the neuron, kernel, activation function.
- Inputs must be in images (or assumed to be images)
- Using Forward propagation technique with certain property to process it faster
- CNNs best for object detection, image classification, computer vision

### Architecture of CNNs
