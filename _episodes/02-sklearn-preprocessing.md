Machine Learning Neural Network (normally consists of 1 hidden layer: Shallow Network)

Deep Neural Network (multiple hidden layers)

### Forward Propagation
- The process that data passes through multiple layers of neuron from input layer to output layers.
- The image below demonstrates that data from input layer passing through 1 neuron by connection through the dendrite with specific weight for each connection. 
- The bias is also added to adjust the output from neuron
- Output of neuron is converted using activation function in order to map with the output layer.
- Since there is only 1 way direction of the data, so this method is called forward propagation
