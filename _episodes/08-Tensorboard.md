#  Tensorboard

- TensorBoard is a visualization web app to get a better understanding of various parameters of the neural network model and its training metrics.
- Such visualizations are quite useful when you are doing experiments with neural network models and want to keep a close watch on the related metrics. 
- It is open-source and is a part of the Tensorflow group.

## Some of the useful things you can do with TensorBoard includes â€“

- Visualize metrics like accuracy and loss.
- Visualize model graph.
- Visualize histograms for weights and biases to understand how they change during training.
- Visualize data like text, image, and audio.
- Visualize embeddings in lower dimension space.
