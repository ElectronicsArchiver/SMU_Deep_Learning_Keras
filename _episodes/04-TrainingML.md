## Train model using Linear Regression




## Tuning parameter using `trainControl`
- One of the most important part of training ML models is tuning parameters. 
- You can use the `trainControl` function to specify a number of parameters (including sampling parameters) in your model. 
- The object that is outputted from trainControl will be provided as an argument for train.
- `trainControl` is optional input. By default, it's gonna use bootstraping
